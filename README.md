Abstract
We propose a novel architecture for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that integrates perception, precision targeting, adaptive optimization, and higher-order evolutionary learning in a continuous feedback loop. The system—termed Reality-Driven Adaptive AGI (RDA-AGI)—enables dynamic situational assessment, targeted action selection, robust adaptation under uncertainty, and meta-cognitive evolution through memory consolidation. Unlike conventional task-specific AI, RDA-AGI exhibits emergent behaviors, cross-domain adaptability, and long-term self-improvement, offering a pathway toward versatile, autonomous, and resilient general intelligence.
1. Introduction
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aims to create systems capable of human-level cognitive flexibility and adaptive decision-making across diverse domains. Current approaches largely rely on specialized neural networks or reinforcement learning frameworks constrained to narrow tasks. We introduce a holistic AGI framework that leverages continuous feedback between environmental modeling, goal targeting, optimization, and meta-evolutionary learning, forming a closed-loop cognitive architecture. This design allows the system to operate effectively in uncertain, dynamic environments while continuously refining its internal models.
2. Architecture
The RDA-AGI architecture consists of four interconnected modules forming a continuous loop:
1.	Reality & Uncertainty Testing (RUT):
The system perceives environmental data, evaluates uncertainty, and constructs probabilistic representations of the current state. Techniques may include Bayesian inference, generative modeling, and multi-modal sensory integration. RUT ensures robust situational awareness and uncertainty quantification.
2.	Precision Targeting (PT):
Based on the RUT output, the system selects precise goals or actions optimized for the current state. PT uses predictive modeling, decision-theoretic frameworks, and contextual prioritization to determine the highest-value targets for execution.
3.	Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO):
The system executes selected actions while continuously monitoring outcomes and environmental changes. ARO applies adaptive learning algorithms, robust optimization techniques, and error-corrective feedback to maintain performance under uncertainty and unforeseen perturbations.
4.	Higher-Order Evolution & Memory (HOEM):
Observed outcomes, successes, and failures are consolidated into long-term memory structures. HOEM supports meta-learning, evolutionary adaptation of strategies, and cross-domain generalization. The system can modify its own algorithms, representations, and goal structures based on historical experience.
The output of HOEM feeds back into RUT, completing the continuous improvement loop. This cyclic interaction ensures perpetual adaptation, learning, and self-optimization.
3. Capabilities
The RDA-AGI system exhibits a diverse set of capabilities across multiple cognitive and operational dimensions:
•	Cognitive Flexibility: Capable of switching between domains, tasks, and goals with minimal retraining.
•	Adaptive Decision-Making: Prioritizes actions in dynamic, uncertain environments using real-time feedback.
•	Robust Learning: Maintains performance under incomplete or noisy data through uncertainty modeling and robust optimization.
•	Meta-Learning & Self-Evolution: Evolves strategies, models, and heuristics based on long-term memory and higher-order learning.
•	Emergent Problem Solving: Generates novel strategies and solutions for previously unseen tasks.
•	Task Partitioning and Resource Allocation: Dynamically allocates computational and cognitive resources for multitasking and parallel objectives.
•	Resilience and Redundancy: Minimizes catastrophic failure through continuous monitoring and adaptive error correction.
•	Knowledge Transfer: Applies insights from one domain to enhance performance in another, enabling cross-domain generalization.
•	Continuous Improvement Loop: Perpetual refinement of perception, decision-making, execution, and learning through iterative feedback.
4. Discussion
The proposed architecture bridges perception, decision-making, adaptive learning, and evolutionary cognition in a unified AGI framework. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, RDA-AGI incorporates meta-cognition and memory-driven evolution, enabling long-term self-improvement and generalization. The system is inherently modular, allowing integration with specialized AI models while maintaining autonomous adaptability. Potential applications include autonomous robotics, strategic planning, cybersecurity operations, and real-time decision support.

 
5. Conclusion
RDA-AGI is a closed-loop AGI architecture that integrates reality testing, precision targeting, adaptive optimization, and higher-order evolution. By combining dynamic situational assessment with robust, meta-cognitive learning, the system demonstrates capabilities that surpass traditional task-specific AI, providing a pathway toward scalable, versatile, and resilient general intelligence.
